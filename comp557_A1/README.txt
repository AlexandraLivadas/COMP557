My character's name is Arthur!

The root node is the torso of the character. I created helper "set" methods for each node class to assist with the XML parser. 
For lighting, I used a combination of the Lambertian and Blinn-Phong methods as presented in class. The kd and ks values of each GeometryNode
can be set individually, but the other lighting components are setup and specified in the BasicPipeline class. Note that Quad.java and Sphere.java 
were also altered to include the color vector. 

The image, Key Frame Animation, and movie files for Objectives 10-12 are under the data directory.
